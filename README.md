# Initial Commit

This repository will host files for the 7th street parking campaign. The goal is to get permits for the 900 block of 7th street (between Washington and Idaho) in order to alleviate congested parking situations due to nearby workers, church-goers, students.

##Tools
As of this commit:

- [ ] NodeJS
- [ ] Node Mailer
- [ ] Nodejitsu
- [ ] Grunt

The above technologies are assumed. I still have no experience with running two node web servers on a single instance while simultaneously rendering on a single port. Apparently this can be done using a node http proxy but whether or not that is exploitable and worth the effort is still TBD.
