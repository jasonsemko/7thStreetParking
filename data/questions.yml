  - question:
    q: What about guests of mine?
    a: The city allows each unit or home the ability to purchase two guest passes. You may also print up to 25 temporary single day passes for an event.
  - question:
    q: Does the permit only work on our block?
    a: No thats the great thing. These permits would allow us to park within other permit zones up to a 2 block radius. This means 6th and 5th street would be available essentially doubling the amount of parking available. (Most of 5th and 6th St are restricted to us currently)
  - question:
    q: Will everyone in my home or apartment have to sign?
    a: No just one person per home or apartment.
